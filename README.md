# DatePicker

Yet another jQuery-based date picker!  This date picker provides an easy way of creating both single and multi-viewed calendars capable of accepting single, range, and multiple selected dates.  Easy to style, with two example styles provided: an attractive 'dark' style, and a Google Analytics-like 'clean' style.

## Quick start

Download the latest release, and jQuery.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/datepicker/js/datepicker.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css" href="/js/datepicker/css/base.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css" href="/js/datepicker/css/clean.css" />
    
    <div id="simple-calendar"></div>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $('#simple-calendar').DatePicker({
        mode: 'single',
        inline: true,
        date: new Date()
      });
    </script>
